# FindMe

A free, open source, competitor to [LookFor](http://lookfor.cl). Yes it's a webapp. No it won't be the same as a native app. I just didn't want to pay 99Â¢ for something I could build myself for fun.

***

## Quick Start

Project setup using [ng-boilerplate](http://ngbp.github.io/ngbp/). To build:

```sh
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ grunt watch
```
